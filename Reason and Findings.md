## Reason and Findings 

Are There Rules to Stop Harmful Preservatives in India?

Yes, India has food safety regulations, but they are not as strict as in the EU.
🚨 Key Regulations on Preservatives in India:

✔️ FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) Act, 2006 – Regulates food additives and preservatives.
✔️ Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954 – Set limits on preservative use but is outdated.
✔️ Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 – Allows only "permitted preservatives" with limits.
✔️ FSSAI Ban on Potassium Bromate (2016) – Banned after being linked to cancer.
✔️ FSSAI Ban on Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) – No longer allowed in soft drinks.
🚫 But Many Harmful Preservatives Are Still Allowed

    Sodium Benzoate, BHA, BHT, Sulfites, Sodium Nitrite, MSG → Still legally used in India despite health risks.
    No mandatory warning labels like in the EU.
    Enforcement is weak, and small food manufacturers often ignore limits.
    
## 🔎 What Needs to Change?

1️⃣ Stronger Enforcement of Bans – Stricter penalties for companies violating food safety laws.
2️⃣ More Consumer Awareness – Labeling should be clearer, with health warnings like in the EU.
3️⃣ Encouraging Natural Preservatives – Incentives for companies to use safer alternatives.
4️⃣ Regular Policy Updates – The FSSAI should ban more harmful preservatives, based on global research.

🚨 Bottom Line: India has rules, but enforcement is weak, and companies prioritize profits over health. Consumers must stay informed, read labels, and avoid processed foods with harmful additives.
