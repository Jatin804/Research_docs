## Why Do Companies Use Harmful Preservatives in India?

Despite health risks, companies continue to use these harmful preservatives in India due to the following reasons:
## 1️⃣ Cost-Effectiveness

    Preservatives extend shelf life, reducing food waste and increasing profits.
    Natural preservatives like vinegar, lemon, or rosemary extracts are more expensive than synthetic alternatives.

## 2️⃣ Lack of Consumer Awareness

    Many consumers in India don’t check food labels or are unaware of harmful ingredients.
    Unlike in the EU, Indian food packaging lacks strict warning labels for additives linked to health risks.

## 3️⃣ Loopholes in Regulations

    The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulates food safety but allows many preservatives that are banned in other countries.
    Companies comply with outdated rules that haven't been revised as strictly as in the EU or Japan.
    Some additives have “safe limit” restrictions but are still used in multiple foods, leading to cumulative toxicity in consumers.

## 4️⃣ High Demand for Processed Foods

    With urbanization and busy lifestyles, packaged and processed foods are widely consumed.
    Companies use preservatives to keep food “fresh” for longer periods in supermarkets.

## 5️⃣ Industry Influence & Weak Enforcement

    Large food corporations lobby against stricter bans to keep production costs low.
    Even if the FSSAI bans a preservative, enforcement is weak, and some manufacturers still use them illegally.
